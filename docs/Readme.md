# Readme

This presentation is built using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/).

Files:
 - Presentation.html: the template 
 - Presentation.md: the content of slides

As the content is hosted in a dedicated file, it requires a http server to serve the content.

Run `lwssc.exe` to start a local http server to serve static content. Details: [lwsss](https://github.com/vcaraulean/lwssc).

`Show.ps1` will run the server and open presentation file in a browser.
